Terrascale is a cloud-native data storage, analysis and visualization engine with first-class support for geospatial data and real-time streaming. It includes

* An HTAP database with ANSI SQL support and Python programmability
* First-class support for geospatial vector data and raster imaging
* First-class support for incremental queries over real-time data
* A programmable, embeddable visualizer for scalar, vector-image and raster-image queries
* A collaborative editor with real-time, CRDT-resolved edits and version history
* Source data snapshots and version control

Terrascale is designed to support a variety of user scenarios online operations and offline analysis of real-world data. Key scenarios include operation support, such as tracking and building custom real-time visualizations of autonomous vehicles and robots operating in the real world, as well as real-world scientific sensor analysis. Terrascale is not a GIS suite, but forms a potential basis for one.

Terrascale consists of the following software components:

* TerrascaleDB, a cloud-native distributed storage and query engine
* The Terrascale Visualizer, a high-performance in-browser rendering engine
* The Terrascale API, which provides frontend and backend programability
* The Terrascale app, a real-time collaborative, version-controlled studio for analysis projects
