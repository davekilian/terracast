# Terrascale: Planet-Scale Analytics

Terrascale is a cloud-native data storage, analysis and visualization engine with first-class support for geospatial data and real-time streaming. It includes

* An HTAP database with ANSI SQL support and Python programmability
* First-class support for geospatial vector data and raster images
* First-class support for incremental queries over real-time data
* A programmable, embeddable visualizer for scalar, vector-image and raster-image queries
* A collaborative editor with real-time, CRDT-resolved edits and version history
* Source data snapshots and version control

Terrascale is designed to support a variety of user scenarios involving real-world data and measurements, including online operations and offline analysis, all on a single dataset. For example, a customer might use Terrascale to build realtime monitoring, visualization and alerting for autonomous vehicles, then run large-scale analysis to mine their operational data for trend insights. Others might use Terrascale to integrate satellite raster data with on-the-ground sensors data collected in real time via an IoT network, to feed online or offline analysis and/or monitoring. Terrascale is well suited for geographic analysis scenarios, but it is not a full GIS suite; however, its extensibility model allows it to act as a potential basis for one.

Terrascale consists of the following software components:

* TerrascaleDB, a cloud-native distributed storage and query engine
* The Tile Delivery Network (TDN), a CDN for raster image tiles
* Terrascale's Visualizer, a high-performance in-browser 2D rendering engine and database client
* Terrascale Projects, a real-time collaborative, version-controlled studio for scientific analysis
* The Terrascale API, which provides frontend and backend programability for the above
* Terrascale, an in-browser webapp which provides a unified experience for all the above

Although the initial build of Terrascale will be optimized for cloud computing scenarios, we plan to design up front to make it feasible to deploy Terrascale on the edge, as (for example) a ruggedized box housing a small cluster of compute/storage nodes running Terrascale. We abstract away cloud-native storage systems and compute orchestration APIs to make it simpler to build a local clustering system, and we have designed Terrascale to work with a very small number of compute nodes from the start. Fully lighting up this scenario would require additional currently-off-roadmap work, such as a synchronization engine for moving portions of datasets between the edge and the cloud, as well as implementations of our storage-layer abstractions suitable for use on bare-metal clusters.

In this document, we will build Terrascale from the bottom up, starting from our cloud-native data management and tile rendering architecture, then moving onto client-side experiences such as the visualization engine and extensibility surface, and finally onto the Projects experience hosted on Terrascale's website.

## Cloud Provisioning

Terrascale is a multi-tenant service through which customers manage single-tenant TerrascaleDB instances running in a third-party cloud such as AWS, Azure or GCP. In this way, TerrascaleDB clusters are similar to Snowflake's virtual warehouse concept. This gives customers fine-grained control over the compute-vs-cost tradeoff, and isolates resource-intensive analytical queries to the customer's private compute cluster. This also provides strong isolation of customer data for security-sensitive scenarios than a multi-tenant compute cloud could provide.

## Database Workloads

TerrascaleDB is a hybrid transactional/analytical database with support for high-volume short-lived transactional queries in tandem with low-volume resource-intensive analytical (cross-tabulation) queries. Queries can execute on a finite point in time, or update continually over real-time streaming data. Users can independently scale compute and storage resources as a means to control the cost-performance tradeoff of their queries.

Kinds of queries we expect and optimize for include...

**Point reads and writes**: Workloads where users build their datasets from operational data such as sensor data ingestion or logging human interactions with software, will be characterized by point writes, potentially at a high rate with high parallelism, with each write inserting a single row. From Terrascale's point of view, these workloads may be write-only (when users host their operations in a separate system and stream updates to Terrascale, e.g. using a mechanism like Postgres's change data capture), or they may be a read-write-mix if users directly host their operations in Terrascale. In general, the point reads and writes generated by this aspect of a customer workload will each be confined to a single table partition.

**Time- and space-windowed queries**: As data streams into a Terrascale instance, we expect to see queries over small space and time ranges as users export their data for human visualization or programmatic observability (monitoring and alerts). We usually expect these small windowing queries to run periodically at a low rate, but anticipate that sometimes these views may be "slashdotted" and thus see a high rate of read-only traffic. These queries may run finitely or use incremental streaming, and each query will usually cross only a small number of table partitions.

**Bulk import**: Customers using Terrascale for offline analytics may bulk-import data from other sources, either as a one-time event to populate a cluster or as part of a nightly ETL database dump. This kind of workload is characterized by just one or two write transactions each inserting many, many rows, crossing all partitions of a cluster. It is unusual for customers to run other kinds of queries while this is ongoing; for example, an ETL customer will likely load all data into Terrascale before starting any new analytical queries. As such, it is okay for a bulk import to cause a storm of traffic that doesn't settle until the import has completed. Bulk import operations need to be restartable, whether through a checkpoint/restart protocol or idempotency.

**Analysis**: Users are expected to use their datasets, whether built operationally or via obtained via a bulk import, for large cross-tabulating analysis queries featuring complex filters, grouping, aggregations, cross-table joins, and spatial joins. Although users are expected to run few of theses kinds of queries at a time, each may necessitate a large amount of compute, storage and network traffic. Additionally, analytical queries may either run in a finite point-in-time or as incremental realtime streaming; the latter is useful for scenarios like anomaly detection and alerting.

**Complex updates**: As part of cleaning and maintaining large and complex datasets, we expect users will occasionally need to issue one-off 'corrections' to their datasets. These are characterized by large, complex transactions which may read many rows, do some sort of computation, and push many updates. Data cleaning transactions and table schema changes are examples of this kind of update. These large transactions are challenging to handle well, since they may cross many table partitions and need to have full serializable semantics; however, because they are low volume and only happen occassionally, we don't optimize for these. We simply ensure these produce the correct results without causing excessive downtime for real-time and operational workloads.

**Bulk export**: Customers may wish to do large, point-in-time bulk reads to export data from Terrascale as part of a wider ETL process that copies or backs up Terrascale data to a separate system. Like bulk import, exports need to provide consistency and restartability, whether the latter is achieved through idempotency or a checkpoint/restart protocol.

TODO the data types are expected to be scalar, 1D spatial, multidimensional spatial, time; this is not a document store and there is no current plan to handle semi-structured data.

## Storage Model

TerrascaleDB includes a thin storage abstraction layer responsible for interfacing with external storage APIs and network interfaces. This eases the process of moving Terrascale between cloud providers and potentially makes it simpler to light up custom hardware solutions and on-prem scenarios. 

The storage layer defines three kinds of storage:

* **Block devices** provide a high-cost, low-latency file system with write-in-place semantics. Some block devices are **durable**, making them appropriate for staging customer data. Others are **volatile**, making them appropriate for cache-spilling, staging external writes and storing intermediate results
* **Object stores** provide low-cost, high latency buckets of write-once unstructured data objects. Depending on the implementation, object stores may be strongly consistent or eventually consistent; as such, the object store abstraction is always exposed as eventually consistent.
* **Catalogs** are small, strongly consistent key-value stores. These can be used for bookkeeping information needed to detect and correct for object store eventual consistency artifacts, and are also appropriate for other bookkeeping, like the set of tables which exist and their schemas.

The indexing layer consumes this storage model for storing TerrascaleDB's row data and log-structured merge index. Client writes are staged in a write-ahead log stored on a durable block device, and runs of log-structured merge trees are staged to volatile block devices during the checkpointing and merge processes. These structures are lazily destaged into object-store objects and read back in through a tiered memory / volatile block store cache. One catalog store per database instance is used to track tables, schemas, durable block files of note (e.g. the WAL), object store objects (such as the row store and LSM runs), and information needed to recover the WAL (such as replay start pointer).

In the cloud, durable block devices are cloud block stores such as EBS or managed disks accessed through a local file system. Volatile block devices are locally-attached disk instances, also accessed through the local file system. Object stores wrap cloud object stores like S3 and block blobs. Catalogs wrap cloud-native table storage like DynamoDB or Azure's tables. 

In the future, TerrascaleDB may be extended to run on small clusters of hardware nodes (e.g. an on-the-go ruggedized 'edge' offering). In this setup, durable block devices and object stores might be implemented as a custom replicated protection protocol over physical disks, with n-way replication for durable block storage and Reed-Solomon erasure coding for objects. Volatile block devices might be implemented as non-protected disk storage (no replication or erasure coding). Catalogs might be implemented using a third-party / open-source database running on each node in the cluster.

TODO Where do checksums live? Can this layer checksum by itself, or are we relying on the higher level layers to decide where in the file checksums go? It's possible for a GFS-like stream to manage checksums automatically, but we don't have structured append-only storage. And we likely have file system checksumming underneath us too, but we want to checksum as early as possible and pass checksums down the stack as far as we can. I think there are relatively reasonable checksumming strategies for the indexing layer, like per log flush buffer and per-b-tree page, so it's not a disaster if we push checksumming up a level. But if we can make it transparent at this layer, that's nice. One of the problems with transparent checksumming is this layer doesn't know the read block size of the parent.

TODO what about encryption? Do we manually encrypt all of our own stuff in-proc, or do we rely on a file system filter kind of thing to do full-volume encryption transparently? Having this layer transparently encrypt stuff in-proc makes more sense here, you basically need a key store with a KEK or something and then you use your catalog to remember which external secret store key is the one you need for these files. Then you plug in a protected key blob into the block/object layer when opening the block/object store and have the abstraction layer transparently encrypt/decrypt on the fly. Ideally this can be done at the abstraction layer, so that the individual store implementations don't have to manage encryption/decryption logic themselves. Also, it'd be nice to include a new checksum on encrypted data post-encryption, which is another good argument for checksumming at this store layer. But we already talked about why that's not such a great idea.

## Indexing Structures

TerrascaleDB indexes data using a log-structured merge strategy inspired by ideas from Apache Druid and WiscKey.

Like in WiscKey, new rows are logged to a dedicated 'row store' in arrival order, are indexed externally using log-structured merge trees, and are cleaned up using copy-forward garbage collection. Storing rows out-of-page with respect to the log-structured merge tree index incurs additional read amplification (since rows are not in the tree and must be fetched with an additional read after the tree lookup) but allows for lower write amplification (since the rows themselves do not need to be rewritten with the rest of the tree on checkpoint and merge). This design is particularly well-suited to modern flash memory, which provide good parallel random-read performance but provide poor wear characteristics on write-heavy workloads.

TerrascaleDB uses a dual indexing strategy over this arrival-order row store. One of the indexes is a traditional row-oriented log-structured merge tree which maps primary keys to the corresponding location in the row store. The other index is a columnar inverted index inspired by Apache Druid. The row index is well-suited for answering OLTP queries that request individual rows (including point queries and bounding-box window queries), and the columnar index is well-suited for OLAP (cross-tabulation) queries that feature large-scale aggregation and grouping with potentially complex multidimensional filters.

Dual-indexing enables hybrid transactional/analytical processing, at the cost of doubling the write amplification and storage overhead of a traditional row-only or column-only index. Storing (relatively large) row payloads out-of-page in a separate, garbage-collected row store reduces the write amplification and space overhead of dual-indexing, leading to manageable write/space amplification overhead.

TODO column store provides a natural scheme for computing bounding boxes over spatiotemporal data, which can then be further refined with fine-grained collision detection at query time. More detail to follow.

TODO segue with we begin by examining the basic data structures that exist in a TerrascaleDB table and then we talk about basic management operations writing ahead, checkpoint and merge. Finally, we discuss query algorithms for scalar-transactional, scalar-analytical and spatiotemporal data.

### The Row Store

TODO this is an incrementally-built B+ tree which maps unique row identifiers to full row blobs. The row index and column index both refer to rows by their row numbers in this store. But this probably can't be as simple as a B+ tree if we want to support copy-forward GC, unless we're willing to copy-on-write the B+ pages themselves, which, idk, maybe we are. Sit on this a little more.


### Memory Tables

### Row Tables

### Column Tables

---

Old content moved here:

In TerrascaleDB, the column index for a given column is an LSM Tree which maps column values to a set of matching rows. The leaf level of this LSM Tree uses very wide pages (multiple megabytes per page), which are further compressed, like a traditional column log. For values that appear only in a few rows, the row numbers are stored directly in the tree; for larger row sets, the rows are stored out of page using a roaring bitmap. For each row set, a result count is stored directly in the tree to facilitate fast aggregation.

### Write-Ahead, Checkpoint and Merge

### Garbage Collection

### Queries and Access Paths

### Geospatial Indexing

TODO all we need to say here is that nothing special happens; rows are indexed by primary key, and we don't support geospatial primary keys. The interesting part is what we do with columns, which is to compute bounding boxes and store them as overlapping ranges with one dimension per column, with range breakdown to handle overlaps. This allows us to index by bounding box by finding overlapping ranges in each column, and taking the set intersection of all row sets to get a set of all items which are near the bounding box. The query layer must then do fast-rejects on the 'actual' query bounding boxes and then any detailed join algorithms, which may be accelerated for large sets using spatial structures like kd-trees. 

We don't implement r-trees or anything else. It may be worth documenting some of the old ideas I had around geospatial z-ordered octrees which can be managed using an LSM strategy, as something we could consider if we ever found a compelling use case.

## Aggregate Analysis

TODO Anything you can do on unsorted columnar data, you can also do on an inverted index. When you come across a column value in an inverted index, you repeat whatever you would have done with your columnar forward index as many times as there are matching bits in the bitset.

More concrete examples: min just gets the lowest matching column value that has nonzero bits, count distinct and sum just look at number of instances of each column value, and mean is just sum divided by count. Some functions like ranks and percentiles need larger scans and may require more work, and/or approximation algorithms if we can find them (think like the quick select median of medians).

## Transactions and Concurrency Control

TODO this is an LSN-ordered publish log for write-only (WO) transactions, snapshot isolation for read-only (RO) transactions at any scale (point, window, analytical), and a predicate locking scheme for read-write (RW) transactions for the complex update scenario. WO transactions are written to one of the active write-ahead logs with a single record that describes and commits the transactions, whereas RW transactions commit incrementally, with the final commit piggybacked on the last incremental write. Recovery replays committed transactions and ignores uncommited ones; since this is an LSM, there is only a log, so there is nothing to undo.

The problem that needs to be solved here is how to rectify an ahead-of-time LSN ordering scheme with long running RW transactions with unpredictable predicate locking. If the predicates can be found ahead of time, we can ensure serializability easily, but if RW transactions can incrementally lock more and more predicates, it's not clear how to let that happen without locking the whole WO publish queue. An RW transaction can

But that's fine, I think we document two schemes. If it's possible to predicate lock for an RW transaction ahead of time, then the RW transaction simply acquires all predicate locks, waits for all preceding RW or WO transaction, then executes on its own isolated snapshot view of the world. If for some reason that is not feasible for some queries, those must lock the entire WO queue, which sucks but at least we can do some background buffering so when RW finally publishes, all WOs that were waiting on it show up instantly as well.

## Query Path Selection and Optimization

TODO go read redbook.io - Volcano maybe was the major paper in this space?

## Distributed Queries

TODO this is raft for distributed commit of transactions. A good question is who plans and optimizes the query. It could be a random node in the network, or it could be the raft leader (if that wouldn't be a bottleneck, at least the leader is always up to date, right?) or it could be a multi-tenant cloud orchestration service sitting in front of the cluster (but I'd rather do everything in the cluster if possible, since we want to keep open the possibility of shipping a small cluster of nodes in a box).

## Geospatial

TODO this is columnar range breakdown to find matching items within bounding boxes, then analytical collision detection and other spatial algorithms to finish joins and whatnot

## Incremental Queries and Real-Time Streaming

TODO this is mostly a division into cases, what kinds of things the language supports and how we update these over time.

## Imperative Language Support

TODO I want this to essentially be a way of executing queries, without having to build/parse SQL strings, and help cast them to the types that users want to run calculations over, like numpy arrays or that nd thing that I remember seeing geo people really excited about

## Tile Delivery Network

TODO is this third party CDN? Nodes serving data from inside your network? Just putting tiles into objects and serving them over cloud URLs? Any processing that has to be done, you can do inside your processing cluster, right?

## Tile Processing

TODO obviously this can't be SQL. Should it be shaders? Who executes the shaders?

## Embeddable, Programmable Visualizer

TODO this is a 2D rendering engine for tile and vector data that runs in a native app using C/Vulkan or on the web with Emscripten/WebGPU. 

## Projects and Version Control

TODO define some kind of project object model, introduce CRDTs for common operations, describe a database scheme for tracking version history

## Terrascale.io

TODO first party hosting for all this stuff. Billing and stuff.
